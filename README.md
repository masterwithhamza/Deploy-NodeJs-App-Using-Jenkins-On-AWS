# Deploy-NodeJs-App-Using-Jenkins-On-AWS

I deployed a Node.js application on AWS using Jenkins to automate the CI/CD pipeline. Jenkins orchestrates the build, testing, and deployment stages, ensuring a seamless and efficient workflow for every code change. The deployment leverages AWS services such as EC2 for hosting. This setup enhances productivity by enabling continuous integration and deployment, reducing manual effort and accelerating delivery times. The result is a reliable, scalable Node.js application with automated deployment processes, ensuring high availability and performance.
